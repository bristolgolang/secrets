# Getting Started

Try running `go mod init secret` to create a new module.
This should create a go mod file for you.

After this you'll want to start writing Go!

```go
package main

func main() {
    println("Hello World!")
}
```

The above ought to be runnable, you can run it with `go run .` or `go run main.go`.

- [ ] [Parsing the subcommands](./01-parsing-args.md) (`secret set`/`secret get`)
